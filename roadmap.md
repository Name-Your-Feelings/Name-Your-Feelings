# Roadmap

A static image is just a holding place. The longterm goal is a simple, easy-to-use resource for identifying how you are feeling on-the-fly. It's intended as free tool for therapists, community building, and YOU. We will never store or sell your data. Feel your feelings, but first, let's try to name them. 

- Goal 1: Static Image (Done, added 2021-02-02 from https://allthefeelz.app/cc/feeling-wheel/)
- Goal 2: Simple Emotion Selector that Gives more specific words and definitions (I.E. Choose "Sad", offer: lonely, hungry, stressed, etc)
- Goal 3: Implement first-step AI from [AI.tier2.tech](https://AI.tier2.tech), allow visitors to enter short description of what they feel with emotion selector, provide more specific feelings.

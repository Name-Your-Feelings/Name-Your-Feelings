This project is intended as a playground for a lightweight tool that helps people of all ages to identify the specific emotions 
they're feeling so they can better ask for help or find resources that will specifically aid in lifting them from their experiences, 
and to better connect with our communities. 

Know what you're feeling. Name it, feel it, let it go, and grow from it.
